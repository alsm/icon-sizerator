# Icon Sizerator - Apple App Store icon generator

This tool is a standalone service built in JavaScript on Node.js, which serves to assist iOS App creators in icon generation.

Icon Sizerator is designed with throughput and low-cost in mind.  The backend image processing is performed by ImageMagick.

You can of course use the provided service at http://icon-sizerator.davidjpeacock.ca/, but if you wish to install this locally you can do so simply by cloning this repo and running `node iconsizerator.js`.

Contributions of issues and pull requests are most welcome.

TODO: Auto-clean stale uploads/* folders; currently this is performed by a cron job, but this should happen within the code itself.
